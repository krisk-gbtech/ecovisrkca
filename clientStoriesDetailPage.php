                <p>KEO Films, which had recently won a contract to make an Australian adaptation of a UK TV
                series, was put in touch with Ecovis Sydney in November 2012 because they needed to
                establish their imprint quickly, before Christmas!</p>

                    <div class="col-md-9">The key reasons or questions for which the client associated with us and
                      wanted us to completely focus were, How should Australia's presence
                      be manifested? Could they acquire bank loan capital for a commercial
                      property they had chosen for purchase while still being a start-up in
                      Australia? How quickly could all of this occur?<br>

                <div class="d-flex">
                    <div class="col-md-3">Our Solutions</div>
                    <div class="col-md-9">We quickly identified the best structure for combining asset protection,
tax efficiency (in terms of their UK/Australia interaction), and
management of their new Australian business.<br><br>



This included a main trading company, a secondary company to hold a
primary production property, and a third company to hold the
intellectual property that they expected to develop in Australia.<br><br>



We had all three companies registered with ASIC (with David Conley as
resident director for each) and registered for all necessary taxes with
the ATO and OSR within a few days.<br><br>



We ensured that any necessary agreements between the three entities
and the UK parent were considered, in order to satisfy Australian/UK
laws and potential transfer pricing issues, by referring them to a local
commercial lawyer.<br><br>


We ensured that the client was advised on options for potential
secondments of UK employees to Australia to assist in the local
operations through a referral to a local immigration agent, and we
enabled the client to quickly determine the best fit for their needs
through a referral to several banks, and they were able to purchase.
